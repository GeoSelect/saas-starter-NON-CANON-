# Happy HOA Brand Guidelines

## 1. Overview
Welcome to the Happy HOA branding kit!  
This package provides assets, references, and best practices for implementing a consistent, modern, mobile-friendly brand experience.

## 2. White-Label Portal Demo + Private Label Reports (CCP)
**Current Status:** Building client demo showing Happy HOA branding across two distinct contexts:

### A. Portal UI (White-Label)
- **Scope:** Entire workspace interface for the HOA/property manager
- **Usage:** Navigation, headers, buttons, backgrounds, all portal pages
- **Assets:**
  - Logo: `/logo/happy-hoa-logo.svg` (hero sections, navbar)
  - Colors: `/colors/palette.md` (primary UI, accents, buttons)
  - Typography: `/typography/typography.md` (all headings and body text)

### B. Private Label Reports (CCP-06)
- **Scope:** Individual report documents generated by the HOA/property manager for their residents
- **Usage:** Reports use the HOA's own branding (their logo, colors, business details)
- **Happy HOA Attribution:** Appears as "Powered by Happy HOA" byline (footer, watermark, or attribution section)
- **Report Features:**
  - Custom logo upload (HOA's logo)
  - Custom colors (HOA's brand palette)
  - Custom footer text (HOA's business details)
  - Version control (PATCH creates versions, immutable records)
  - Single-active constraint (one report version active at a time)
  - Auto-activation with admin checks (403 for non-admin writes)

### Demo Route
- **Live Preview:** `/preview/ccp-06-branded-reports`
- **Shows:** Report creation form + table of branded report versions with activate/edit/delete controls

### Test Cases

#### Test Case 1: Custom Logo and Colors (Multi-Tenant Simulation)
- **Scenario:** Multiple HOA customers, each with their own branding
- **Setup:**
  - Create Report A: "Sunset Ridge HOA" with custom logo + warm color palette (orange/brown)
  - Create Report B: "Lakeside Properties" with custom logo + cool color palette (blue/teal)
  - Create Report C: "Mountain View HOA" with custom logo + earth tone palette (green/tan)
- **Validation:**
  - Each report displays correct logo in preview
  - Each report uses correct custom colors (primary, secondary, accents)
  - Footer text correctly shows each HOA's business details
  - Version history preserved per report
  - Single-active constraint: only one version active per report at a time
  - Admin permission check: non-admin users cannot activate/patch/delete

#### Test Case 2: Default "Happy HOA" Branding
- **Scenario:** Reports generated without custom branding fallback to Happy HOA defaults
- **Setup:**
  - Create Report D: Using all default values (no custom logo, use Happy HOA colors)
- **Validation:**
  - Default Happy HOA logo displays in header
  - Default color palette used (Ocean Blue #2563EB, Sunshine Gold #FCD34D)
  - "Powered by Happy HOA" attribution visible in footer
  - Report styling matches Happy HOA brand guidelines
  - Branding consistent across all default-branded reports

## 3. Logo Usage
- Use only provided SVG/PNG logos
- Clear space: maintain 24px padding around logo
- Do not distort, recolor, or place on busy backgrounds

## 3. Color Palette

- **Primary:** #219653 (green)
